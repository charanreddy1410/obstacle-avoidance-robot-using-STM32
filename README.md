# obstacle avoidance robot using STM32
 Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot built using STM32,Ultrasonic sensor,SG-90,L298N motor shield,other peripherals.
